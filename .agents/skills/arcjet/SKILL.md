description: Add Arcjet security protection to HTTP routes, AI agent tool calls, MCP servers, background jobs, and queue workers. Covers rate limiting, bot detection, email validation, prompt injection, sensitive information blocking (including Rampart NER), content moderation, capture/flush, remote Guard policies, typed inputs, and abuse prevention. Works in JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, and Go. HTTP frameworks share this skill. JS Guard adapters that ship on npm are per-adapter reference files loaded from Step 3 — do not keep the whole JS Guard reference in context. Official Python adapters (including Google ADK) have dedicated integrate-arcjet-guard skills, as do JS Cloudflare Think and Microsoft Agent Framework for Go. Use when the user wants security, rate limiting, bot protection, or abuse prevention – "protect my API," "rate limit tool calls," "block bots," "secure my endpoint," or "prevent abuse" – even without naming Arcjet.

Python Guard adapters for LangChain, CrewAI, OpenAI Agents, Claude Agent SDK, Claude Managed Agents, Strands Agents, and Google ADK are dedicated skills (see Step 3). JS Guard adapters that ship on npm are per-file references under `references/guards_js_*.md`. JS Cloudflare Think is a dedicated skill (published `@arcjet/guard` plus peer `@cloudflare/think`). Shared fundamentals stay in [references/guards_javascript.md](references/guards_javascript.md) and [references/guards_python.md](references/guards_python.md).

## Add Arcjet protection to your app

### Checklist

- [ ] **Step 1:** Verify language support (JS/TS, Python, or Go only – stop if unsupported)
- [ ] **Step 2:** Connect to Arcjet platform (CLI → MCP → manual Console setup)
- [ ] **Step 3:** Detect protection type and read the appropriate reference file
- [ ] **Step 4:** Implement protection (separate client file, correct SDK, correct patterns)
- [ ] **Step 5:** Verify decisions are firing correctly (trigger a real call, then check CLI / MCP / Console)

### Step 1: Check language support

If the project's server-side code is not JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, or Go → tell the user in chat that Arcjet doesn't support their language yet. Don't modify the project, don't write a `NOTES.md`, don't invent a package. Just say it and stop.

### Step 2: Get an `ARCJET_KEY` into the project's env file

Before writing any code, the project needs a real `ARCJET_KEY` in its env file. Don't write Arcjet code first and "leave the key as a TODO" – that just produces dead code. Get the key first, then wire it up.

**Agent identity (when you need to register yourself, not a human browser login):** follow https://arcjet.com/auth.md exactly. Do not invent registration, claim, or token-exchange flows, and do not print secrets.

**In order of preference:**

1. **Arcjet CLI** (preferred). Check whether you're already signed in, then retrieve a key.
2. **Arcjet MCP server** (endpoint: `https://api.arcjet.com/mcp`) – for clients with built-in MCP. See [references/mcp.md](references/mcp.md).
3. **Manual** (last resort): tell the user to grab a key from https://console.arcjet.com.

#### CLI bootstrap (the normal path)

```bash
npx -y @arcjet/cli@latest auth status        # is the user already signed in?
# if not signed in:
npx -y @arcjet/cli@latest auth login         # browser device flow, see references/cli.md

npx -y @arcjet/cli@latest teams list --output json --fields id,name
npx -y @arcjet/cli@latest sites list --team-id <team_id> --output json --fields id,name
# if no suitable site exists:
npx -y @arcjet/cli@latest sites create --team-id <team_id> --name "<project>"

npx -y @arcjet/cli@latest sites get-key --site-id <site_id> --output json --fields key
```

Write the `key` value to the project's env file as `ARCJET_KEY=ajkey_...`. Match whatever the project already does – filename, `.env.example` companion, `.gitignore` entry. If the project doesn't have a convention yet, default to whatever the framework expects and add the env file to `.gitignore`. Never hardcode the key in source.

See [references/cli.md](references/cli.md) for install options beyond `npx`, agent-mode flags, and the full command reference.

#### Install the SDK with the project's package manager

Once you know which SDK you need (see Step 3), install it with the package manager the project already uses: `npm install`, `pnpm add`, `yarn add`, `bun add`, `pip install`, `uv add`, `poetry add`, or `go get`. Don't hand-edit `package.json` / `requirements.txt` / `go.mod` and guess a version: typed versions go stale (`@arcjet/next` is currently `1.13.0`; Python `arcjet` is `1.2.0`; Go must use a module tag, not a copied pseudo-version), and the lockfile/module metadata won't get updated. Let the package manager pick the real version and pin it.

### Step 3: Detect protection type and read the reference

Determine which protection type applies:

| | **Request-based** | **Guard** |
|---|---|---|
| **When to use** | Code has an HTTP request object (Express `req`, Next.js `Request`, FastAPI `Request`) | No HTTP request (tool calls, MCP handlers, queue workers, background jobs, agent loops) |
| **JS/TS SDK** | Framework adapters such as `@arcjet/next`, `@arcjet/node`, `@arcjet/fastify` | `@arcjet/guard` |
| **Python SDK** | `arcjet` (with `arcjet()` / `arcjet_sync()`) | `arcjet` (with `launch_arcjet()` / `launch_arcjet_sync()`) |
| **Go SDK** | `github.com/arcjet/arcjet-go` (with `NewClient`) | `github.com/arcjet/arcjet-go` (with `NewGuardClient`) |
| **Entry point** | `protect(request)` / `Protect(ctx, r)` | Core JS `guard({ label, rules })`; Python `guard(label, …)`; Go `Guard(ctx, request)`. Wrappers take `action`, not `label`. |

A single project can use both – for example, request-based on API routes and Guard on agent tool calls. If the project already uses a supported agent framework, prefer the official wrapper over hand-wrapping every tool. In Python, load the dedicated skill (table below) — not a raw `guard()` around every callable, and not the JS `@arcjet/guard/...` path. In JavaScript, load fundamentals plus **exactly one** adapter from the JS table — not the sibling adapters. Cloudflare Think loads [integrate-arcjet-guard-cloudflare-think](../integrate-arcjet-guard-cloudflare-think/SKILL.md) from that table, not a `guards_js_*.md` file and not `@arcjet/guard/vercel-ai/v7`. Install published `@arcjet/guard` plus the `@cloudflare/think` peer. In Go, load the Microsoft Agent Framework skill when that framework is present; otherwise use `GuardAction` from the Go Guard reference.

**Coding-agent hooks (Claude Code / GitHub Copilot) are a third path.** There is no SDK and no `guard()` call. Publishing a policy attached to **Execute on** (Tool call, Prompt, or Model switch) turns it on. Install the HTTP hooks from https://docs.arcjet.com/coding-agents — copy the templates, do not invent URLs. Hook URLs must not name a policy and must omit `?surface=` (managed settings reach CLI, IDE, Desktop, and cloud; a hard-coded `cli` mislabels most traffic). Author the policy via MCP ([references/mcp.md](references/mcp.md)).

**Common misclassifications to watch for:**

- **MCP servers**: the word "server" is misleading. MCP tools don't receive HTTP requests – they're invoked by an MCP client over stdio or SSE. Use **Guard**, not request-based.
- **Background jobs / queue consumers**: no HTTP request at the protection site. Use **Guard**.
- **Server actions / RPC over HTTP** (Next.js server actions, tRPC): there *is* an HTTP request underneath. Use **request-based**.
- **Agent tool calls inside a request handler**: if you want to limit per-user-per-route, request-based is fine. If you want per-tool budgets independent of any HTTP boundary, use Guard at the tool call site.

Read the appropriate reference:

- **Request-based JS/TS**: [references/requests_javascript.md](references/requests_javascript.md)
- **Request-based Python**: [references/requests_python.md](references/requests_python.md)
- **Request-based Go**: [references/requests_go.md](references/requests_go.md)
- **Guard JS/TS fundamentals**: [references/guards_javascript.md](references/guards_javascript.md) — then exactly one adapter file from the table in that file (source of truth; do not copy it here)
- **Guard Python**: [references/guards_python.md](references/guards_python.md)
- **Guard Go**: [references/guards_go.md](references/guards_go.md)

When the project already uses an official JS agent framework, open the fundamentals file and load **exactly one** adapter from its table. Do not open sibling adapters. Cloudflare Think is the dedicated-skill exception: load that skill from the table.

When the project already uses an official Python agent framework, load the dedicated skill instead of the long adapter sections that used to live in the Python Guard reference:

| Python framework | Import | Skill |
| --- | --- | --- |
| LangChain (`BaseTool` / `create_agent`) | `arcjet.guard.langchain` | [integrate-arcjet-guard-langchain-py](../integrate-arcjet-guard-langchain-py/SKILL.md) |
| CrewAI | `arcjet.guard.crewai` | [integrate-arcjet-guard-crewai](../integrate-arcjet-guard-crewai/SKILL.md) |
| OpenAI Agents | `arcjet.guard.openai_agents` | [integrate-arcjet-guard-openai-agents-py](../integrate-arcjet-guard-openai-agents-py/SKILL.md) |
| Claude Agent SDK | `arcjet.guard.claude_agent_sdk` | [integrate-arcjet-guard-claude-agent-sdk-py](../integrate-arcjet-guard-claude-agent-sdk-py/SKILL.md) |
| Claude Managed Agents | `arcjet.guard.claude_managed_agents` | [integrate-arcjet-guard-claude-managed-agents-py](../integrate-arcjet-guard-claude-managed-agents-py/SKILL.md) |
| Strands Agents | `arcjet.guard.strands_agents` | [integrate-arcjet-guard-strands-agents-py](../integrate-arcjet-guard-strands-agents-py/SKILL.md) |
| Google ADK (`LlmAgent` / `Runner`) | `arcjet.guard.google_adk` | [integrate-arcjet-guard-google-adk-py](../integrate-arcjet-guard-google-adk-py/SKILL.md) |

When the project is Go and already uses Microsoft Agent Framework for Go, load the dedicated skill:

| Go framework | Surfaces | Import | Skill |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Microsoft Agent Framework | `functool`, `mcptool`, `agent.Config.Middlewares` | `github.com/arcjet/arcjet-go/agentframework` | [integrate-arcjet-guard-agent-framework-go](../integrate-arcjet-guard-agent-framework-go/SKILL.md) |

These references explain architectural decisions and patterns that can't be inferred from the source code alone. For exact API signatures, read the installed package's types and doc comments.

### Step 4: Implement protection

Follow the patterns in the reference file from Step 3. Key principles:

#### Request-based (HTTP routes):
- Create shared clients outside handlers and include Shield as a base rule. Use the exact constructor and rule names from the language reference. JS HTTP rules omitted `mode` default to `DRY_RUN` – pass `mode: "LIVE"` to enforce. Python HTTP factories require `mode=` (`TypeError` if omitted). Go HTTP Protect rules also default to dry run – set `Mode: arcjet.ModeLive` to enforce.
- In JavaScript/TypeScript, create one `arcjet()` client and use `withRule()` for route-specific extras so clones share the decision cache. Check `decision.isDenied()`. Sibling `arcjet()` constructors do not share cache. `detectBot` requires exactly one of `allow` or `deny` (neither or both throws).
- In Python, create one `arcjet()` / `arcjet_sync()` client and use `with_rule()` for route-specific extras so clones share `DecisionCache`. Check `decision.is_denied()`. Sibling constructors do not share cache.
- In Go, create one `NewClient` at package scope. `WithRule()` derives route-specific clients that share the parent cache, and returns `(*Client, error)`, so handle initialization errors. Check `decision.IsDenied()`. Separate `NewClient` calls do not share cache.
- Call `protect()` / `Protect()` inside each route handler (not in app-level middleware), once per request.
- Map denial reasons to HTTP responses. Only branch on reasons that produce a *different* response – there is no point in a Shield-specific arm that returns the same status as the default 403.
- Put the language's `userId` characteristic selector on the specific rule that needs it, then pass a **trusted, authenticated** user ID at protection time. Never rate limit by a client-controlled header unless a trusted proxy strips and rewrites it.
- Treat client-IP provenance as security configuration. JavaScript, Python, and Go may fall back to common forwarding headers when no usable public address is available and produce one `client_ip_provenance="unverified-header"` warning for the lifetime of each SDK client instance. Configure every trusted proxy and verify the application is reachable only through infrastructure that overwrites or safely appends forwarding headers. Never silence the warning by copying a client-controlled header into a manual override.
- If the application already has an independently trusted client IP, pass it explicitly: `ipSrc` (JS), `ip_src` (Python; also set `disable_automatic_ip_detection=True` when constructing the client), or `WithIPSrc` (Go). The SDKs reject malformed values, although JS treats an empty `ipSrc` as omitted. Syntax validation does not prove provenance. Before shipping, inspect representative requests with JS `clientIpDetails()` / `findIpDetails()`, Python `client_ip_details()`, or Go `ClientIPDetails()`.
- `protect()` accepts nested-JSON `metadata` (same shape as Guard). It does not affect fingerprinting. Do not put secrets or PII in it. When present, request decisions also expose optional IP threat intelligence (`decision.ip.threat` / `ip_details.threat` / `IP.Threat`).

#### Guard (non-HTTP code):
- Client at module scope: `launchArcjet()` (JS), `launch_arcjet()` / `launch_arcjet_sync()` (Python – match async vs sync), `NewGuardClient` (Go).
- Rules at module scope. **One `guard()` per operation with a hardcoded slug label** (`tools.get-weather`). Interpolated labels break grep and Console grouping. Slugs: lowercase letters, digits, `-`, `.`, `_` only; start and end with a lowercase letter or digit; max 256 bytes.
- `metadata` is nested JSON for audit only. No secrets or PII. `capture()` is visibility, never a decision – flush on shutdown. Python helper `success` is not "the action ran" – see the Python Guard reference.
- Free `guard()` (JS/Python registration) fail-opens if nothing is registered. Go has no registration API. Prefer an explicit client.
- Prefer official wrappers over hand-wrapping. Import the **versioned** JS path and load that adapter file from Step 3. Load the dedicated Python skill from Step 3. Unversioned `@arcjet/guard/<adapter>` aliases do not resolve.
- **Branch on which rule denied**, not just `DENY`. Guard `decision.reason` is a flat string (`"PROMPT_INJECTION"`) and is `undefined` on ALLOW. A denial by one rule still spends the others' budget in the same `rules` array – split calls if a PII false positive must not drain a rate limit.
- Every rate-limit rule needs a `key` and a `bucket`. Use a trusted user/session id when you have one; otherwise a stable identifier you control.

**JS adapters:** wrappers fail closed; core `guard()` fails open. Load the Step 3 file (or the Cloudflare Think skill) for the project's framework. `npm install @arcjet/guard` or `pnpm add @arcjet/guard` is enough for every published adapter — plus `actor` / `inputs` / `validateGuardLabel`. Cloudflare Think is the same published `@arcjet/guard` install plus peer `@cloudflare/think`; load [integrate-arcjet-guard-cloudflare-think](../integrate-arcjet-guard-cloudflare-think/SKILL.md). Do not pin a git SHA.

**Python:** `guard_action` / `guard_action_sync` is core. Load the dedicated skill for the project's extra (`arcjet[langchain]`, `arcjet[langchain-agents]`, `arcjet[openai-agents]`, `arcjet[claude-agent-sdk]`, `arcjet[claude-managed-agents]`, `arcjet[strands-agents]`, `arcjet[google-adk]`). There is no `arcjet[crewai]` extra. `validate_guard_label` and adapter `actor` / `inputs` are in PyPI `arcjet` **1.2.0**. Google ADK is `pip install "arcjet[google-adk]"` or `uv add "arcjet[google-adk]"` — load [integrate-arcjet-guard-google-adk-py](../integrate-arcjet-guard-google-adk-py/SKILL.md). Do not pin a git SHA.

**Traps that run without error and enforce nothing** (full write-up in the Guard references and https://docs.arcjet.com/llms.txt):

- Guard has no `sensitiveInfo` rule – that is HTTP `protect()` only. Use `localDetectSensitiveInfo` / `LocalDetectSensitiveInfo`.
- Python `LocalDetectSensitiveInfo()` with neither `allow` nor `deny` fail-opens as ALLOW (`AJ1203`). Always pass a list. JS works with no args; still pass a list.
- The sensitive-info rule does **not** inherit the client's backend. Entity types beyond `EMAIL` / `PHONE_NUMBER` / `IP_ADDRESS` / `CREDIT_CARD_NUMBER` need `backend` on the rule. Share one Rampart instance with the client.
- A label the service will not match reads as `ALLOW` with `hasFailedOpen()` / `has_failed_open()` false, so the guard silently does not run. `@arcjet/guard` 1.13.0 and PyPI `arcjet` 1.2.0 refuse one up front: adapter factories throw / raise `ArcjetInvalidLabelError`, and a capture warns `AJ1023` and still sends. Check a label you build yourself with `validateGuardLabel` / `validate_guard_label`.
- A remote policy that declares `actor` or typed `inputs` only fires if this call sends them. Import `policyInput` from `@arcjet/guard` (not an adapter path). Python uses `server_input` / `local_input`. Check installed types — do not pass fields a helper does not declare.
- A missing decision is not a denial. If the model asks a question or masks values itself, Guard never runs. Verify in Console/CLI.
- Guarding one tool only helps if it is the only path. Claude Agent SDK needs `settingSources: []` / `setting_sources=[]` **and** `strictMcpConfig: true` / `strict_mcp_config=True`.
- HITL (`needsApproval`, `human_input`, `can_use_tool`, `event.interrupt()`, `always_ask`) is not a policy gate.

#### Conventions outside the Arcjet flow

For everything that *isn't* an Arcjet-specific decision – dev scripts, file/module layout, named-vs-default exports, comment style, env-file naming, type hints, error class patterns – match the project's existing conventions. If the project has no convention yet, default to modern best practice for the language. This skill is opinionated about *where Arcjet goes* and *how its API is used*; it must not reach further than that.

### Step 5: Verify decisions

After wiring up protection, confirm it's actually firing. Three steps:

**1. Type-check / build first.** Run `tsc`, `next build`, `python -m py_compile`, or whatever check command the project uses. Catches wrong imports, wrong rule names, and stale type signatures before the user does.

**2. Trigger a real call so a decision exists to check.** Without one, the Console and CLI are empty and you can't tell whether protection is actually wired up.

- **Request-based**: start the dev server (`npm run dev`, `uvicorn main:app --reload`) and `curl` the protected route with the method the route actually accepts (`curl -I` is HEAD – FastAPI GET-only routes answer 405, not the documented 403). Empty `bots.allow` / `allow=[]` denies `CURL` before later rules run – temporarily `allow: ["CURL"]` when you need to reach email or rate-limit checks, then drop it. To trip a rate limit: `for i in {1..50}; do curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" http://localhost:3000/api/your-route; done`.
- **Guard**: invoke the protected function so a decision exists. A missing decision is not a denial – read Console/CLI, not the absence of a side effect. Don't test Guard by `curl`ing anything.

**3. Confirm the decision in the Arcjet platform.**

- **CLI**: `npx -y @arcjet/cli@latest requests list --site-id <id>` (request-based) or `... guards list --site-id <id>` (Guard)
- **MCP**: `list-requests` / `list-guards`
- **Console**: https://console.arcjet.com

For deeper investigation: `arcjet requests explain --site-id <id> --request-id <id>` or `arcjet guards explain --site-id <id> --guard-id <id>`.

If you can't run the app in the current environment, tell the user exactly what to do (which command to run, what to look for in the output) instead of silently skipping verification.

### Gotchas

- **Wrong SDK/client**: `@arcjet/guard`, `arcjet.guard`, and Go's `NewGuardClient` are for non-HTTP code. `@arcjet/node` / `@arcjet/next` / Python `arcjet()` / Go `NewClient` are for HTTP routes.
- **Wrong placement**: `protect()` must not be called in Express middleware or Next.js middleware. Call it inside each route handler.
- **Wrong layer for `guard()`**: don't put `guard()` in a generic dispatcher. Use the official wrapper from the table above, or put `guard()` inside the specific tool. Load the dedicated Python skill instead of hand-wrapping.
- **Python adapter denials and HITL:** load the dedicated skill. Capture handlers never block. HITL is not a policy gate. Helper `metadata.outcome` details live in the Python Guard reference.
- **Hand-edited dependency manifests**: run the project's package manager so the version is real (`@arcjet/*` 1.13.0, Python `arcjet` 1.2.0).
- **Double-counting**: calling `protect()` or `guard()` multiple times for the same operation counts against rate limits multiple times.
- **Client-IP warning bypass**: never "fix" an `unverified-header` warning by copying `X-Forwarded-For` into `ipSrc` / `ip_src` / `WithIPSrc`.
- **JS denial envelopes:** one `ArcjetDenialResult` payload; delivery is per-framework. Read the adapter file from Step 3 before inventing a status or throwing. `guardTool` and `guardAction` are different handlers.
- **Never hardcode `ARCJET_KEY`** – always use environment variables.

## Choose protections

When you need to pick which rules address the user's concern – bot abuse, rate limits, prompt injection, signup spam, PII, or IP filtering – load [references/choosing_protections.md](references/choosing_protections.md). It maps common problems to Arcjet rules and explains the tradeoffs between strategies (for example token bucket vs sliding window). The mapping doesn't need to be in your context for the rest of the workflow.

## Resources

For exact API signatures, parameter names, and the full set of rules and helpers, read the installed SDK's source – types and docstrings are the source of truth:

- **Python SDK**: https://github.com/arcjet/arcjet-py – `arcjet` package (request protection) and `arcjet.guard` subpackage (non-HTTP guard).
- **Python Guard integration skills**: [integrate-arcjet-guard-langchain-py](../integrate-arcjet-guard-langchain-py/SKILL.md), [integrate-arcjet-guard-crewai](../integrate-arcjet-guard-crewai/SKILL.md), [integrate-arcjet-guard-openai-agents-py](../integrate-arcjet-guard-openai-agents-py/SKILL.md), [integrate-arcjet-guard-claude-agent-sdk-py](../integrate-arcjet-guard-claude-agent-sdk-py/SKILL.md), [integrate-arcjet-guard-claude-managed-agents-py](../integrate-arcjet-guard-claude-managed-agents-py/SKILL.md), [integrate-arcjet-guard-strands-agents-py](../integrate-arcjet-guard-strands-agents-py/SKILL.md), [integrate-arcjet-guard-google-adk-py](../integrate-arcjet-guard-google-adk-py/SKILL.md).
- **JS Cloudflare Think skill**: [integrate-arcjet-guard-cloudflare-think](../integrate-arcjet-guard-cloudflare-think/SKILL.md).
- **JavaScript / TypeScript SDK**: https://github.com/arcjet/arcjet-js – monorepo with framework-specific packages (`@arcjet/next`, `@arcjet/node`, `@arcjet/fastify`, `@arcjet/sveltekit`, `@arcjet/guard`). JS Guard adapter files: [references/guards_js_vercel_ai.md](references/guards_js_vercel_ai.md) and siblings listed in Step 3.
- **Go SDK**: https://github.com/arcjet/arcjet-go – `github.com/arcjet/arcjet-go` module with request and guard clients. `go get github.com/arcjet/arcjet-go` resolves **v1.0.0** (Go 1.25+). Microsoft Agent Framework helpers live in a separate module: `go get github.com/arcjet/arcjet-go/agentframework` resolves **v0.1.0** and needs Go 1.26+.
- **Guard policies**: author and publish via MCP (`list-guard-policies` / `describe-guard-policy` / `validate-guard-policy` / `put-guard-policy`). The CLI has no policy commands. Application policies select by `label` / `action`. Coding-agent policies attach by **Execute on** (Tool call, Prompt, or Model switch); publishing turns them on — the hook URL must not name a policy and must omit `?surface=`. Install templates: https://docs.arcjet.com/coding-agents.
- **Agent registration**: https://arcjet.com/auth.md — follow that file; do not reproduce the ceremony here.
- **Docs**: https://docs.arcjet.com – narrative guides, blueprints, and product reference.
- **Console**: https://console.arcjet.com – sites, keys, and decision history.
