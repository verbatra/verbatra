# Go request protection

## What request protection is

Request protection inspects `net/http` requests – headers, IP, body – to enforce security rules on API routes and handlers. The Go SDK works with `net/http` and routers/frameworks that expose `*http.Request`.

## Installation

The current release is **`github.com/arcjet/arcjet-go` v1.0.0** (September 17, 2026), which `go get ...@latest` resolves. It requires Go 1.25+. Nested `Metadata`, `WithIPSrc`, Rampart, `decision.IP.Threat`, and Protect transport-failure ERROR decisions are all in it. If the project uses an older Go toolchain, warn the user and stop until it is upgraded.

Install with Go tooling, not by editing `go.mod` directly:

```bash
go get github.com/arcjet/arcjet-go@latest
```

Read the installed package docs for exact API signatures.

## Architecture: why things go where they do

### Client at package scope

Create one `arcjet.NewClient` at package scope or in a shared package such as `internal/security`. Reuse it across handlers.

```go
package security

import (
	"os"

	"github.com/arcjet/arcjet-go"
)

var Client = must(arcjet.NewClient(arcjet.Config{
	Key: os.Getenv("ARCJET_KEY"),
	Rules: []arcjet.Rule{
		arcjet.Shield(arcjet.ShieldOptions{Mode: arcjet.ModeLive}),
	},
}))
```

Do not construct a client inside each handler; it wastes connections and makes rules harder to manage.

When `Key` is empty, `NewClient` reads `ARCJET_KEY`. An explicit `Key` wins. That env fallback is intentional Go policy (same as `NewGuardClient`), not a missing-key bug. There is no `ARCJET_ENV` switch.

### Protect inside handlers

Call `Protect(ctx, r, ...)` inside each route handler, once per request. Do not put it in generic middleware that runs on every path, including static assets; that removes per-route control and can double-count traffic.

```go
decision, err := security.Client.Protect(r.Context(), r)
if err != nil {
	// Arcjet fails open. Log and continue, or apply your fallback policy.
	log.Printf("arcjet: %v", err)
} else if decision.IsDenied() {
	status := http.StatusForbidden
	if decision.Reason.IsRateLimit() {
		status = http.StatusTooManyRequests
	}
	http.Error(w, "denied", status)
	return
}
```

On a Decide transport failure, `Protect` returns an `ERROR` decision alongside `err`. `IsAllowed()` and `IsErrored()` are both true – do not treat a missing `err` as the only fail-open signal. Programmer errors (nil client, nil request) still return the zero `Decision{}`.

Use `client.WithRule(...)` to derive a route-specific client when a handler needs extra rules beyond the shared base protection. Derived clients share the parent cache. Separate `NewClient` calls do not. `WithRule` returns `(*arcjet.Client, error)`, so construct derived clients during initialization and handle the error rather than ignoring it.

## Choose rules

For rule selection and rate-limiting strategy comparisons, see [Choose protections](choosing_protections.md).

- `Shield` – always include. Set `ShieldOptions{Mode: arcjet.ModeLive}` to enforce. **Every HTTP Protect rule defaults to dry run** when `Mode` is the zero value – not only Shield.
- `DetectBot` – request-based only; pass exactly one of `Allow` or `Deny`.
- Rate limits – `TokenBucket`, `FixedWindow`, `SlidingWindow`; use `WithRequested(n)` for variable-cost calls and `WithCharacteristics(...)` for user/session keys.
- `ValidateEmail` / `ProtectSignup` – signup and login forms. `ProtectSignup` returns `[]Rule` (bot + email + rate limit) – assign it to `Config.Rules` or `append` other rules. It is not a single composite rule like JS `protectSignup`.
- `SensitiveInfo` – scans text locally before it leaves the process; pass text with `WithSensitiveInfoValue(...)`. Default backend is WASM (email, phone, IP, card). For names, addresses, and government / financial identifiers, set `Backend` to a `rampart.New(...)` from `github.com/arcjet/arcjet-go/sensitiveinfo/rampart`. `SensitiveInfoOptions.ContextWindowSize` is an `int` (default 1); a custom `SensitiveInfoDetect` sees a window of that size. `GuardSensitiveInfo` does not expose this option – its window is always 1.
- `DetectPromptInjection` – pass untrusted user text with `WithDetectPromptInjectionMessage(...)`. There is no threshold option.
- `Filter` – block by IP metadata, country, VPN/proxy/Tor, or request-local fields.

`NewClient` and `WithRule` sort local Protect rules like JS: SensitiveInfo → Filter → Shield → RateLimit → Bot → Email → PromptInjection. Same-priority rules keep declaration order. Do not treat Go Protect as declaration-order evaluation. SensitiveInfo-first is a privacy property – it denies before another rule can forward the payload.

## Request context

Pass the real `*http.Request` and `r.Context()` so Arcjet respects cancellation and extracts IP/header metadata correctly. Outside a supported platform, the SDK first uses a public `RemoteAddr`. When the direct peer matches `Config.Proxies`, it walks `X-Forwarded-For` right-to-left. If `RemoteAddr` is missing or non-public, it may use a public address from a common forwarding header; that result has `Provenance == "unverified-header"`, `Verified == false`, and produces one warning for the lifetime of the SDK client. Set `Config.Proxies` to every trusted proxy IP/CIDR, make the app reachable only through them, and ensure they overwrite or safely append forwarding headers. Malformed entries are rejected; `0.0.0.0/0` and `::/0` emit a warning, while the exact addresses `0.0.0.0` and `::` do not. If the app runs on a known platform, set `Config.Platform` when appropriate.

When the context has no deadline, `Protect` and `ProtectDetails` apply 2s (4s when an email rule is present). The prompt-injection 1s floor is already met. A caller-supplied deadline is never shortened.

For user-based characteristics, use identity established by trusted authentication middleware or a verified token/session. Do not trust a caller-controlled header as a user ID unless a trusted proxy strips incoming values and rewrites the header.

## Correlation IDs

Pass `arcjet.WithCorrelationID(id)` to `Protect` to correlate this decision with guard calls, workflow runs, or agent traces. It is a dedicated field, not `WithExtra` or `Metadata`, and does not affect the decision.

## Explicit client IP

If the application has already determined the client IP from a trusted source, pass `arcjet.WithIPSrc(ip)`. On current `main`, empty and malformed values are rejected. Syntax validation does not establish provenance – do not pass a client-controlled header.

Before shipping, inspect representative staging requests with
`client.ClientIPDetails(request)`. Check `IP`, `Provenance`, `Verified`, and
`Header`; the same values are logged at debug level with
`client_ip_provenance`, `client_ip_verified`, and `client_ip_header`. The
diagnostic call does not log or consume the once-per-client warning. Never copy
`X-Forwarded-For` into `WithIPSrc` to bypass a warning.

## Metadata

`Protect` accepts `Metadata` as `arcjet.Metadata` (`map[string]any`) – nested JSON, not `map[string]string`. It does not affect fingerprinting or the cache key. Do not put secrets or PII in it.

## IP threat intelligence

When present, `decision.IP.Threat` is optional threat metadata (`RiskLevel`, `Confidence`, `Reputation`, `IsSafe`, `Activities`, …). Always check for `nil` before reading.

## Outbound HTTP proxy

Available in **`arcjet-go` v0.1.0**: standard `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, and `NO_PROXY` environment variables are honored for outbound Arcjet API calls. Do not log proxy URLs because they may contain credentials.

## Key patterns

- Use `ModeLive` for enforcement and `ModeDryRun` to observe before blocking. HTTP Protect omitted `Mode` is dry run for every rule.
- Map only denial reasons that need different responses: rate limits usually return 429; email, sensitive info, and prompt injection often return 400; bot, shield, and filter denials usually return 403.
- Keep `ARCJET_KEY` in the environment. Never hardcode it.
